This is a repository for various test programs I have written for LoRa devices Programs for the HAB2 tracker need the LoRaTracker Library installed see here;

The programs have been tested against version 1.8.5 of the Arduino IDE.

The user of these programs is expected to have had a reasonable level of experience in using the
Arduino environment. Using the programs does require the user to make configuration changes so
they will need to be able to cope with complier errors due to issues that they may create.
